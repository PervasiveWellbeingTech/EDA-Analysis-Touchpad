EDA explorer can be used as a mean to evaluate the level of noise in the EDA signal.


* Note the in EDA explorer, the entire EDA is divided into equally length epochs (5 (s)), by default, 
then is determined whether a given epoch is noisy or not. 

Use the multiclass classification module in which each epoch of 5 (s) can be classified as clean(+1) or unsure(0) or noisy (-1).

* Also, to use the EDA explorer for noise detection, you must use E4 format. You also need to provide Acceleration and Temperature data 
alongside the EDA signal.
